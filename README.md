# AI-ML-Portfolio

This repositorio contains my personal portfolio of work related to Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Every top-level directory contains an independent project or activity.

## AmazonTargetedCouponsForDrivers

This module contains an activity from Berkeley's Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence where we use statistics and visualizations to distinguish between customers who accepted coupons from an Amazon campaign.

For project details see README in [AmazonTargetedCouponsForDrivers](AmazonTargetedCouponsForDrivers/)
